Fortnite Stealer was made by @xoidfn to make stealing Fortnite Accounts easier with just a Epic Games link generated by the tool. This is an open source project which can be modified in many ways if you know what your doing. Just remember to give credit to @xoidfn on Discord!

### **Setup Instructions**  

To set up Xoid's Fortnite Stealer, follow these steps:  

1. **Download the Stealer**

2. **Install Node.js**  
   - Ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed on your computer. This tool requires Node.js to run.

### **How It Works**  

1. **Account Retrieval**  
   - If someone visits the generated Epic Games link and clicks the **Confirm** button, the page will automatically close.  
   - The stealer will capture their Epic Games account information and provide you with a login link.  

2. **Login Without a Password**  
   - Use the provided login link to access the account at [epicgames.com](https://epicgames.com).  
   - Each login link is valid for **5 minutes**, so make sure to use it quickly.
